# About the mod

## In general

The goal of this mod is to offer different "Quality of Life" features for the game, so features which:
- Gather, calculate, format and display extra information about the game and it's features
    - Examples: [Corruption reference sheet](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#in-game-corruptions--runs-reference-sheet) and [Hepteract ratios](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#in-game-hepteract-ratios)
- Reduce the amount of excessive clicking without fully automating anything
    - For example, the [promotion code injection](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#promotion-code-injection) feature only displays the codes and copies them into the input box on click, but doesn't do it all automatically
- Allow for adjusting or configuring things in the game
    - For example, the [notification opacity control](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#game-notification-opacity-control) feature changes the opacity of the in-game notifications
- Provide hotkeys or shortcuts for the game's functions
    - Examples: [Hepteract quick expand and max](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#quick-expand--max-for-hepteracts) and [Additional mouse functionality](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#reactive-mouse-hover-and-auto-click)
- Warn, remind or notify the player of some things
    - Example: [Hepteract quick expand and max](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/wiki/Mod-Features#quick-expand--max-for-hepteracts) feature's "Cost Protection" setting prevents hepteract expansion if the hepteract cost is over a set treshold

In other words, the goal here is to build features which are not too game breaking, automating or streamlining. Even with the mod, players will still need to play the game, but ideally without developing carpal tunnel syndrome or getting fed up about meaningless busywork and clicking around.

# Using the mod

## Create a bookmark

Using the mod is simple. Just create a new bookmark in your browser and name it as you wish. For the URL, copy and paste the following:

```JavaScript
javascript:(function() {
    if('hypersynergism' in window) {
        alert('Hypersynergism is already loaded on the page, please refresh if you want to reload the mod');
        return;
    };

    const scriptSrc = `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy@latest/release/mod/hypersynergism_release.js?r=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000)}`;
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = scriptSrc;

    script.onload = function() {
        console.log('[HSMain] Script loaded successfully!');
        window.hypersynergism.init();
    };

    script.onerror = function() {
        console.error('[HSMain] Failed to load the mod!');
    };

    document.head.appendChild(script);
})();
```

Alertnatively the same loader code can be found in [here](https://github.com/ahvonenj/synergism-hypersynergy/blob/master/release/loader/loader.js).

**Example:**

## Enable the mod

Now just load up the game in your browser (or refresh the page if it's already running) and click on the bookmark **after** you've clicked away the "Since you were away" box.

The bookmark will always load up the latest version of the mod, so once you're set up on your end, you're set for life!

# Latest update(s)

## Hypersynergism version 2.8.0

Released: 21.5.2025

**Ambrosia Heater data export**

You can now find a button in the mod panel's Tools-tab to export an extended
version of your save data for the Ambrosia Heater.

This extended version of save data contains various useful calculations done by the mod
to make the Ambrosia Heater calculate even better results and with less effort from you!

The data export button will automatically copy a Base64 save string to your clipboard, which you can
then paste in to the heater.

**GDS has gone rogue!**

The mod's Game Data Sniffing (GDS) feature, which the mod uses to enable features like Ambrosia Minibars,
no longer requires being violent with the browser's local storage system.

While the... uhh... new hack still (unfortunately) has to perform writes to the local storage,
the mod doesn't need it for anything anymore. Through the magic of some ""creative coding"",
the mod is able to access the data it needs without having to read (or decode!) it from the local storage.

This means that there is now vastly less overhead and performance cost with using GDS, so much so that
I'll probably turn the update frequency up a notch later.

**Automatic version check**

The mod will now perform regular version check every 15 minutes or so.

If a new version is detected, the mod's icon in the top right will shoot rainbows and the mod's panel's
header will say that there is a new version available.

There is also a new button in the Tools-tab should someone want to perform a manual version check.

**Other changes**

- Settings are now split into subtabs (was getting messy)
- Dump game vars button now dumps event, campaign, etc. data as well
- Fixed some bugs with (happy hour) event fetching and buff calculation
- Fixed a potential memory leak issue with how custom prototype-based CSS-transitions were done (sorry!)
- Fixed another potential memory leak issue with how notifications were disposed (sorry!)
- The mod can now calculate a huge number of things from the game data (more on this in the wiki)
- The mod's panel is now resizable! Look for the pink arrow thingy on the bottom-right corner
- Fixed various (minor) bugs here and there with the GDS-based calculations
- Added some tools into the mod's panel to test calculations with


## Hypersynergism version 2.7.4

Released: 17.5.2025

**WebSocket connections**

Implemented a HSWebSocket module for WebSocket connections. A WebSocket connection is needed for the mod to be able to receive e.g. event data such as when (and how many) HAPPY HOURS are up.

This is to say that the mod can now take HAPPY HOUR event(s) into account with it's calculations. Luck and ambrosia generation speed calculations have been updated accordingly.

Note that this is a bit experimental for now, but worry not, if the WebSocket fails, the mod
will just ignore the event buffs like it has done thus far.

**Changes**

- New feature: Ambrosia minibars
- Heavily optimized campaign token fetching for game data related tasks
- Optimized game data display and debug rendering

## Hypersynergism version 2.7.1-2.7.3 - Pirates and Caching

Released: 14.5.2025

**Caching**

The game itself implements caching for most of it's calculations.
Many of these calculations have been pirated into the mod (v2.7.0) which meant pulling them out of the game's caching system.
The mod now implements it's own caching for all the stolen calculations.

**Fixes and stuff**

- Loadout Idle Swapper should now work with Ambrosia Acceleration
- Loadout Idle Swapper will turn itself off, if one or both of the loadouts for it are unconfigured
- Restructured the project a bit for this new data-driven era
- GDS will be auto disabled on save file import
- Mod now displays a very cool notification when it has loaded and initialized
